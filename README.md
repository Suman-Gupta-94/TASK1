# ASSIGNMENT 1
Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
take a as variable and store value 5
b take as variable store value as 10
c take as variable and denote as sum value of a and b
Print c to see output of addition/division/multiplication/substraction one by one below
a=5

b=10

c=a+b

print("additon",c)

a=5

b=10

c=a-b

print("Substraction: ",c)

a=5

b=10

c=a*b

print("multiplication :",c)


a=5

b=10

c=a/b

print("division:" ,c)


Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

#Takes a user's first name and last name as input

We are add first input variable for first name then add 2nd time input variable for for last name

first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")

last_name = input("Enter your last name: ")

#Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name

we declared 3rd variable for storing combine first name and last name with space

3rd variable as full_name and storing concatenation of first name and last name with space like ""

full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

In print

#Print a personalized greeting message using the full name and we add string one by one with  Using the + operator

print ("hello "+full_name+" Welcome to the Python programming world")

or else we can use f string as combining variables within a string

print(f"Hello, {full_name}! Welcome to the Python programming world.")

final_name ="hello "+full_name+" Welcome to the Python programming"
